abstract: Background Approximately 40-70% of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) fall each year, causing decreased activity levels and quality of life. Current fall-prevention strategies include the use of pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies. To increase the accessibility of this vulnerable population, we developed a multidisciplinary telemedicine program using an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) platform. We hypothesized that the risk for falling in PD would decrease among participants receiving a multidisciplinary telemedicine intervention program added to standard office-based neurological care. Objective To determine the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of a multidisciplinary telemedicine intervention to decrease the incidence of falls in patients with PD. Methods Ongoing, longitudinal, randomized, single-blinded, case-control, clinical trial. We will include 76 non-demented patients with idiopathic PD with a high risk of falling and limited access to multidisciplinary care. The intervention group (n = 38) will receive multidisciplinary remote care in addition to standard medical care, and the control group (n = 38) standard medical care only. Nutrition, sarcopenia and frailty status, motor, non-motor symptoms, healthrelated quality of life, caregiver burden, falls, balance and gait disturbances, direct and nonmedical costs will be assessed using validated rating scales. Results This study will provide a cost-effectiveness assessment of multidisciplinary telemedicine intervention for fall reduction in PD, in addition to standard neurological medical care. Conclusion In this challenging initiative, we will determine whether a multidisciplinary telemedicine intervention program can reduce falls, as an alternative intervention option for PD patients with restricted access to multidisciplinary care.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study outlines a randomized clinical trial protocol to evaluate the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of a multidisciplinary telemedicine program aimed at reducing falls in Parkinson’s disease patients with limited access to in-person care. The intervention combines remote physical therapy, medical monitoring, and psychological support, leveraging wearable sensors and AI to enhance personalized treatment and monitor outcomes.
