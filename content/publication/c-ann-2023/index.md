abstract: "**Objective**:
This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a multidisciplinary telemedicine (TM) program to improve lifestyles, the burden of motor and non-motor symptoms (NMS), and quality of life (QoL) in fall patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and high risk of fall.\n\n
**Background**:
Falls in PD are very frequent, with devastating consequences, worse QoL, increasing comorbidity, and social isolation. Telerehabilitation has shown promising effects on motor symptoms, but the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary TM intervention in addition to standard clinical care on NMS, QoL and lifestyle remains unclear.\n\n
**Design/Methods**:
Longitudinal, randomized study. PD Patients with high risk of falling and restricted access to multidisciplinary care were included (NCT04694443). A multidisciplinary TM program plus standard care was allocated to the study group for 4 months and compared to controls (in-office visits, standard care). TM included occupational therapy, nutrition, and PD clinical management. After discontinuing TM, both groups were compared at 8 months. Gait and PD motor severity were assessed using wearable sensors, MDS-UPDRS, Mini-Best and Freezing of gait questionnaire (FOGQ); quality of life (EuroHis-QoL8) and NMS (NMSS), Apathy Severity (LARS) and Depression/Anxiety Scale (BDI-II). Clinical information at baseline vs. 4 and 8-months visits were compared using parametric/non-parametric tests as needed.\n\n
**Results**:
51 PD patients, 48.6 % males, median Hoehn Yhar stage 2 (1;3), mean age 68.6 ± 9.7 years were included. At 4 months, compared to controls, patients on TM had an improvement in the MDS-UPDRS II (p=0.01), Mini-Best (p<0.0001) FOGQ (p=0.01); EuroHis-QoL8 (p=0.004); LARS (p<0.0001) and BDI-II scores (p=0.004). After discontinuing TM at 8 months, FOG (p=0.01), and Mini-Best (p=0.001) scores were better in the TM group compared to controls.\n\n
**Conclusions**:
A multidisciplinary TM intervention alongside with standard care improves gait, QoL and NMS in PD patients with a high risk of falling. Long-term benefits on gait were observed more likely attributed to lifestyle modifications"
summary: "This study demonstrates the positive impact of a multidisciplinary telemedicine program on motor and non-motor symptoms, as well as quality of life, in high-risk fall patients with Parkinson's disease."
