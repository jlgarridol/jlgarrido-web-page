abstract: "Understanding the scientific structure of a field is
pivotal for designing the strategic policy for the research devel-
opment of the discipline and evaluating scientific production. The
objective of this paper is to analyze and understand the structure
of Computing Science as an area of knowledge in Spain. We use
complex network analysis tools on the network representing the
supervision and the participation in the examining committees of
doctoral theses in this field. The results show a scientific network
of academics characterized by a modular structure partially
explained by specialization and a degree distribution compatible
with a truncated power law. Also, we analyze the structure of
the relationships between Artificial Intelligence and the rest of
the fields, using the topic descriptors contained in each of the
theses"
summary: "This paper provides insights into the structure of Computing Science research in Spain, highlighting the relationships between different areas and the role of Artificial Intelligence."
