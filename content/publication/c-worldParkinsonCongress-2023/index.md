abstract: "**Objective**: To analyze the accuracy of assessing bradykinesia in
Parkinson’s disease (PD) using Computer vision.\n\n**Background**: PD is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative
disorder characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms.
Bradykinesia is one of the cardinal symptoms of PD, and it is
characterized by slowness and difficulty initiating voluntary and
involuntary movements. Computer Vision is a field of Artificial
Intelligence that deals with the ability of computers to interpret
images and videos. Detection of PD bradykinesia using computer
vision is an open area of research and has been used to extract
hand movement characteristics during a finger-tapping test.
However, the accuracy of machine learning models has not yet
been established in PD.\n\n**Methods**: Multicenter, cross-sectional, case-control study. Patients
diagnosed with PD and age, and gender-matched controls were
included. We collected a set of videos of the finger-tapping test (left
and right hands) from PD patients and controls. MediaPipe, a
computer vision tool, was selected to extrapolate finger positions
features in each frame, using complex computed statistics. Feature
selection techniques were applied to a set of time-series features
extracted from the videos. These features were used to feed various
machine-learning models for detecting PD bradykinesia. Then, the
best machine learning model was selected based on different
evaluation metrics.\n\n**Results**: 45 patients with PD (56.25%), and 35 controls (43.75%),
41 males (51%%), and 39 females (49%) with a mean age of 69.52
+ 9.22 years, and median Hoehn Yahr stage of 2 (1-3) were
included. The accuracy of Computer Vision for detecting
bradykinesia in PD will be reported.\n\n**Conclusions**: The diagnosis of PD is based on clinical criteria
established by a doctor. By utilizing these techniques, the goal is to
develop a non-invasive and accurate method for detecting PD,
facilitating an early diagnosis and management of the disease. In
addition, computer vision can also assist in tracking the progression
of the disease, providing insight into how the disease is evolving,
which can help to determine the effectiveness of pharmacological
and non-pharmacological interventions."
summary: "This study demonstrates the potential of computer vision as a tool for detecting bradykinesia in Parkinson's disease, highlighting its role in early diagnosis and monitoring disease progression."
