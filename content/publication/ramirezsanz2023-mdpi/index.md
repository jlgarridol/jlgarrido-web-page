abstract: "The consolidation of telerehabilitation for the treatment of many diseases over the last decades is a consequence of its cost-effective results and its ability to offer access to rehabilitation in remote areas. Telerehabilitation operates over a distance, so vulnerable patients are never exposed to unnecessary risks. Despite its low cost, the need for a professional to assess therapeutic exercises and proper corporal movements online should also be mentioned. The focus of this paper is on a telerehabilitation system for patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease in remote villages and other less accessible locations. A full-stack is presented using big data frameworks that facilitate communication between the patient and the occupational therapist, the recording of each session, and real-time skeleton identification using artificial intelligence techniques. Big data technologies are used to process the numerous videos that are generated during the course of treating simultaneous patients. Moreover, the skeleton of each patient can be estimated using deep neural networks for automated evaluation of corporal exercises, which is of immense help to the therapists in charge of the treatment programs."
summary: "This study presents a low-cost telerehabilitation system for Parkinson’s disease patients that uses big data and artificial intelligence to monitor and assess physical therapy exercises in real time via video analysis. The system, tested in a randomized controlled trial, enables therapists to remotely evaluate patient movements using skeleton tracking, offering a scalable and accessible solution for fall prevention and rehabilitation in underserved areas."
