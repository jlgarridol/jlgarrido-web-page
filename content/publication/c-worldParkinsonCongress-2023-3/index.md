abstract: "**Objective**: To analyze the adherence and satisfaction of patients
with Parkinson’s disease (PD) after participating in a
multidisciplinary telemedicine intervention program at home using
videoconferences and remote assessments with wearable sensors.
Background: Nowadays, new technologies are becoming a
fundamental resource in everyday life. PD is more frequent in the
elderly compared to the young, who often do not have the
necessary skills to handle this technology and cannot easily access
social and healthcare resources. On the other hand, remote
assessments and telemedicine can facilitate access to social and
healthcare services, especially for those living in rural, underserved
areas. The Covid-19 pandemic has demonstrated the need to
develop easy-to-use technologies for the entire population, including
patients with PD, but adherence and acceptability of such resources
are still unknown.\n\n**Methods**: Single-center, longitudinal, randomized, two-group study
(NCT04694443). PD patients were followed for 8 months via
wearable monitoring sensors. In addition, the study group used a
simple telemedicine system, with weekly remote Occupational
Therapy sessions and monthly teleconsultations with neurologists
and nurses. Adherence to the program was evaluated by quantifying
the patients who successfully completed their participation in the
program. Satisfaction with the telemedicine system,
teleconsultations, and wearables, was assessed with the
Telemedicine Usability Questionnaire (TUQ), satisfaction structured
questionnaires from 1 (totally satisfied) to 7 (totally dissatisfied), and
with the Quebec Users’ Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive
Technology (QUEST), respectively\n\n**Results**: To date, 38 patients have been included, and 36 patients
(95%) have successfully completed their participation in this
telemedicine program. After completing the program, the patients
reported high satisfaction using telemedicine (mean TUQ score of
139.13±4.34), videoconferences including multidisciplinary health
interventions (mean satisfaction in each session of 1.15±0.49), and
with the wearable sensors (mean QUEST score of 4.35±0.44).
Conclusions: This multidisciplinary telemedicine program for
patients with PD, including videoconferences and remote
assessments with wearables, showed high adherence and
satisfaction. These results demonstrate that telemedicine can be
considered a valid and accepted resource for providing
multidisciplinary care to PD patients."
summary: "This study highlights the importance of telemedicine in managing Parkinson's disease, demonstrating high patient adherence and satisfaction with remote interventions. The findings support the integration of telemedicine into routine care for PD patients."
