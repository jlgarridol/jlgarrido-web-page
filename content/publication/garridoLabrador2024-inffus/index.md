abstract: "Advances over the past decade at the intersection of information fusion methods and Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) are investigated in this paper that grapple with challenges related to limited labelled data. To do so, a bibliographic review of papers published since 2013 is presented, in which ensemble methods are combined with new machine learning algorithms. A total of 128 new proposals using SSL algorithms for ensemble construction are identified and classified. All the methods are categorised by approach, ensemble type, and base classifier. Experimental protocols, pre-processing, dataset usage, unlabelled ratios, and statistical tests are also assessed, underlining the major trends, and some shortcomings of particular studies. It is evident from this literature review that foundational algorithms such as self-training and co-training are influencing current developments, and that innovative ensemble techniques are continuing to emerge. Additionally, valuable guidelines are identified in the review for improving research into intrinsically semi-supervised and unsupervised pre-processing methods, especially for regression tasks."
summary: "This comprehensive review analyzes 128 semi-supervised ensemble learning methods published since 2013, categorizing them by approach, ensemble type, and base classifier, and evaluating their experimental protocols, dataset usage, and statistical rigor. The study highlights the dominance of wrapper methods (especially co-training), the underuse of statistical validation, and the need for more reproducible research, while offering future directions for advancing semi-supervised ensemble learning in information fusion."
