abstract: "This paper applies complex network analysis to unveil the informal structure of the knowledge area of business organization - Organización de empresas - in Spain. To do so, we use the TESEO database. We retrieve and statically analyze all the theses referred to the UNESCO academic field of Organization and management of enterprises. Our results reveal a degree distribution of the participation in thesis examining committees and thesis supervision compatible with a truncated power law. Community analysis of the projected network of co-participation in thesis committees presents modular structure. When we focus on the backbone of such network, we find that the patterns detected can be partially explained by homophily of scholars that interact in the same academic association."
summary: "This study applies complex network analysis to doctoral thesis examination committees in the Spanish academic field of business organization, revealing a modular structure and a degree distribution compatible with a truncated power law, suggesting preferential attachment. The analysis shows that community formation is partially influenced by academic association membership, offering insights into the informal social and disciplinary structure of the field."
