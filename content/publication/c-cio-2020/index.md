abstract: "This paper applies complex network analysis to unveil the informal
structure of the knowledge area of business organization —
Organización de empresas— in Spain. To do so, we use the TESEO
database. We retrieve and statically analyze all the theses referred to
the UNESCO academic field of Organization and management of
enterprises. Our results reveal a degree distribution of the
participation in thesis examining committees and thesis supervision
compatible with a truncated power law. Community analysis of the
projected network of co-participation in dissertation committees
shows a clear modular structure. When we focus on the backbone of
such network, we find that the patterns detected can be partially
explained by homophily of scholars that interact in the same
academic association."
summary: "This paper sheds light on the intricate landscape of doctoral research in Business Organization in Spain, revealing the interconnectedness of various academic communities and their specialization."
