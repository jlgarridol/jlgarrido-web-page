abstract: "SSLearn is an open-source Python-based library that advances semi-supervised learning (SSL) with a focus on wrapper algorithms and restricted set classification (RSC), a novel paradigm. It fosters innovation by allowing researchers to modify methods or create new ones, facilitating access to state-of-the-art algorithms and comparative studies. As the only library incorporating RSC for constrained classification, SSLearn fills an important gap in SSL tools. Fully compatible with Scikit-Learn, it integrates seamlessly into research workflows, lowering the barrier to entry to SSL and catalyzing its adoption in diverse domains. This makes SSLearn a critical resource for advancing SSL research and applications."
summary: "SSLearn is an open-source Python library designed to support semi-supervised learning (SSL), with a focus on wrapper algorithms and restricted set classification (RSC), offering a unique set of tools compatible with Scikit-Learn. It provides researchers and practitioners with a flexible, extensible platform to experiment with, compare, and develop SSL methods, filling a gap in existing libraries by including RSC and enabling easier adoption of SSL techniques in real-world applications."
