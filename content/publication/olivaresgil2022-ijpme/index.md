abstract: "Understanding the scientific and social structure of a discipline is a fundamental aspect for scientific evaluation processes, identifying trends and niches, and balancing the trade-off between exploitation and exploration in research. In the present contribution, the production of doctoral theses is used as a proxy to analyze the scientific structure of the knowledge area of business organization in Spain. To that end, a complex networks approach is selected, and two different networks are built: (i) the social network of co-participation in thesis examining committees and thesis supervision, and (ii) a bipartite network of theses and thesis descriptors. The former has a modular structure that is partially explained by thematic specialization in different subdisciplines. The latter serves to assess the interdisciplinary structure of the discipline, as it enables the characterization of affinity levels between fields, research poles and thematic clusters. Our results have implications for the scientific evaluation and formal definition of related fields."
summary: "This study uses complex network analysis to map the scientific and social structure of the field of Organization and Management of Enterprises in Spain, based on doctoral theses data from the TESEO database. By analyzing co-participation in thesis committees and thesis descriptors, the authors identify modular communities of scholars, thematic specializations, and interdisciplinary connections, offering insights for academic evaluation, research planning, and the formal definition of related fields."
