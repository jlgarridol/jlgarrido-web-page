abstract: "In the face of the global concern about climate change and endangered ecosystems, monitoring individual animals is of paramount importance. Computer vision methods for animal recognition and re-identification from video or image collections are a modern alternative to more traditional but intrusive methods such as tagging or branding. While there are many studies reporting results on various animal re-identification databases, there is a notable lack of comparative studies between different classification methods. In this paper we offer a comparison of 25 classification methods including linear, non-linear and ensemble models, as well as deep learning networks. Since the animal databases are vastly different in characteristics and difficulty, we propose an experimental protocol that can be applied to a chosen data collections. We use a publicly available database of five video clips, each containing multiple identities (9 to 27), where the animals are typically present as a group in each video frame. Our experiment involves five data representations: colour, shape, texture, and two feature spaces extracted by deep learning. In our experiments, simpler models (linear classifiers) and just colour feature space gave the best classification accuracy, demonstrating the importance of running a comparative study before resorting to complex, time-consuming, and potentially less robust methods."
summary: "This study evaluates 25 classification models and five feature extraction techniques—including deep learning and traditional methods—for animal re-identification using annotated video datasets. Surprisingly, simple linear classifiers like Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) combined with basic RGB colour features outperformed deep learning models, highlighting the importance of comparative testing and the potential effectiveness of simpler approaches in complex, real-world scenarios."
